  <h1>My Favorite Constellations</h1>
  <body>
    Here is a list and discription of all of my favorite constellations
  </body>
  <h2>Orion</h2>
  <ul style="list-style-type: square">
    <li>
      The constellation is named after Orion, a legendary hunter in Greek
      Mythology.
    </li>
    <li>There are many greek myths about how Orion came to be in the sky.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In one myth,it is said that Artemis fell in love with Orion and was
        tricked by her brother Apollo into killing Orion. Arrtemis begs
        Ascelpius to heal Orion but Zeus kills Ascelpius before he can heal
        Orion which leads Artemis to set Orion's image in the stars.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another, Orion is banished to the sky for boasting about how many
        animals he would kill, his overconfidence leading to his demise.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a third myth, Orion is too confident in his hunting abilities and
        declares that he would kill every animal in the world. This angers Gaea,
        the goddess of the earth, and she sends a scorpion to kill him. When
        Orion dies, Zeus turns him into a constellation, along with the scorpion
        that killed him creating both the Orion and Scorpius constellation.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>
      Orion is easily identifiable by "Orions Belt" which is a cluster of three
      stars that form Orion's Belt in the constellation.
    </li>

    <li>
      Orion is the first constellation that I discovered in the night sky, it is
      the reason I delved into a deep fascination with stars and constellations.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cassieopeia</h2>
  <ul style="list-style-type: square">
    <li>
      The Cassiopeia constellation is named after Cassiopeia, the Queen of
      Aethiopia.
    </li>
    <li>
      In mythology, Cassiopeia was an arrogant and vain woman. She boasted that
      she was more beautiful than all the Nereids, the nymth daughters of the
      dea god Nereus. Ths angered Poseidon in retalliation he ordered the sea
      monster Cetus to destroy Aethiopia. In an attempt to save her kingdom
      Cassiopeia and her husband, Cepheus consulted an oracle who told them to
      sacrifice their daughter Andromeda. Cassiopeia and Cepheus chained
      Andromeda to a rock as a sacrifice, assuming that Cetus would kill her.
      Andromeda was saved by Perseus who ended up killing Cetus. Posideon, not
      wanting Cassiopeia to escape punishment, chained her to a chair in the
      heavens.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cassiopeia's constellation looks like a big W in the sky which makes it
      pretty easily identifiable.
    </li>
  </ul>
